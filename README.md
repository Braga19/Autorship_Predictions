# Machine Learning Challenge: Predicting Authorship

## Project Overview

This repository contains our work for a Machine Learning Challenge where the goal was to predict the authorship of academic papers based on their abstracts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this challenge consists of abstracts from various academic papers. Each abstract is associated with an author who is identified by a unique ID.

## Methodology & Results

We approached this problem by implementing various machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance, and we finally choose a SVM algorithm (see the [Report](report.pdf) for more details). Our best performing model achieved an accuracy of 19.6% on the test set.
